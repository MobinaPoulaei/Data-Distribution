# Data-Distribution
This Jupyter Notebook is designed for analyzing data distributions and handling skewness using the Titanic dataset. It demonstrates data processing steps including loading, analyzing, visualizing, and applying transformations to normalize data.

Contents:
- Data Loading
- Initial Distribution Analysis
- Data Visualization
- Statistical Tests for Normality
- Skewness Calculation and techniques to Handle it
  - Log Transformation
  - Box-Cox Transformation
- Data Normalization

Expected Outcomes:
- Better understanding of data distribution and skewness
- Ability to apply transformations to normalize data
- Improved accuracy and performance of statistical and machine learning models through data normalization
